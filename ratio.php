<h2> Why this poor ratio ? </h2>

<p>We have only 1 student registering for every 9 students opening the portal, at the time of this writing.</p>
<p> This suggests that students are not filling up the form on the home page. 
We urge you to enter your travel details, here on this portal, so that you can find a carpool for your-self and also help others find a pool</p>
<p> You may not want a CAB , but against what the name suggests, you may find a co-passenger who is willing to accompany you in auto or on MMTS(Local train). Just make sure you mention the same in the description box. <br /> Hope we helped </p>

<p> You can find more instructions in the portal manual <a href="announce.php"> here. </a></p>
<br/>
<p> Regards.</p>
